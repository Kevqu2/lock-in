# anxeity-habits-detector
A privacy-first computer vision prototype that uses AI + real-time body landmarks to detect common anxiety-related habits (e.g., nail-biting, hair-pulling, face-touching, skin-picking). The system leverages MediaPipe  for face/hand landmarks and a lightweight PyTorch model for temporal classification of short landmark sequences.
